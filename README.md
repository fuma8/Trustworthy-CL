# Trustworthy Compressive Learning
This work perform image compression with compressive sensing technique efficiently, and quantify the uncertainty to provide the trustworthy outputs.

This work can be run easily with following command;
```
python cube_resisc45.py
```
where it use RESISC45 dataset.
